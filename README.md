Tetris in Python, not optimized.

Contains five files, four code files, and one text file for saving scores.

The four code files are the following:

Tetris_Main: the main file that runs the game, contains the loops for the menu, game, and scoreboard along with the accompanying logic

Tetris_Grafik: contains most of the graphic settings and logic. Is imported in the main file in full

Tetris_Funktioner: contains most of the functions used in the main file. Is imported in the main file in full

Tetris_Klasser: contains all the classes used. One for the blocks and one for each figure as a polymorphism of one master class for figures

Most comments are in Swedish, I'm an amateur just getting started and all of this is just for fun/training
